 Project Overview

This project aims to identify fake news in a given dataset using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. With the increasing spread of misinformation online, this project provides an algorithmic approach to classify news articles as true or false.

 Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Label distribution, feature visualization, and word frequency analysis.
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and vectorization techniques (TF-IDF, BoW, N-grams, Hashing Vectorizer).
Machine Learning Models: Implemented multiple classifiers:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
AdaBoost with Decision Tree
Voting Classifier
XGBoost Classifier
Big Data Processing: Applied TF-IDF and Hashing Vectorization to handle large-scale text data efficiently.
Performance Evaluation: Compared models based on accuracy, recall, and hyperparameter tuning results.

 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, Missingno
Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib, WordCloud, Folium
NLP Techniques: NLTK, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, CatBoost, XGBoost
Deployment: Flask, Streamlit

 Dataset

Used the LIAR dataset, consisting of 14 attributes and 12,788 instances.
Labels include: True, False, Half-Truth, Mostly-True, Barely-True, Pants-on-Fire.
The dataset was binarized into True (0) and False (1) for classification.

Model Performance

Best Model: Logistic Regression with TF-IDF (Accuracy: 61.38%).
Key Findings:
XGBoost performed well but was computationally expensive.
Voting Classifier using Hashing Vectorizer showed improved robustness.
Adding additional features (e.g., speaker credibility, source reliability) could improve accuracy.
